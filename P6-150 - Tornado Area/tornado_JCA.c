This program will read in a file of tornado data and calculate the area affected by each tornado.
The program will then output the data to a file called report.txt.

//Program Design

//Overall Psuedocode:
/*  1.  Declare variables
    2.  Open input file
    3.  Open output file
    4.  Read in data from input file
    5.  Calculate the area affected by each tornado
    6.  Output the data to the output file
    7.  Close input file
    8.  Close output file
    9.  End program
*/

//Expectations
/*
Write a program to read the tornado.txt file and create a report.
Store the tornado report in a file named report.txt.

The tornado data contains
- The Fujita scale
- The tornado path length in miles
- The tornado path width in yards
These data are in columns

The report should contain the following data for each part, printed in columns:
EF rating
Path Length (miles)
Path Width (yards)
Affected Area (sq miles)
Below the part table, print the total area affected.

*/

//Data Storage (Defined in Main)
/*
File *infile_tornado
- The Input tornado.txt file

File *outfile_report
- The Output Report.txt file

int fujita_scale
- first data on each line
- has to be between 0 - 6

float path_length_miles
- Path length of the tornado

float path_width_yards
- path_width of the tornado in yards

float affected_area
- calculated area affected by each tornado

float running_total
- the running total of the affected area
*/

//Functions (for each function, give the functionâ€™s prototype and 1 or 2 lines describing how the function works.)
/*
1.	void Welcome ();
        Prints a welcome statements and tells the user the purpose of the program

2.	int Open_File (File *infile_tornado);
        Opens the tornado file and reads from it
        Prints error or success message to the terminal
        Returns 404 if unsuccessful
3.	int Get_Data (File *infile_tornado, int *fujita_scale, float *path_length_miles, float *path_width_yards);
        It reads a line of data from the tornado.txt
        Stores them into the pointers
        Uses a local variable [data_fetched]
4.	void Calc_Area (float *affected_area, float *path_length_miles, float *path_width_yards);
        Calculates the area affected for each tornado and keeps a running total of the areas
        Uses the formula [path_width_miles * path_length_yards /1760]
            Divided by 1760 to convert the yards to miles
5.	int Open_OutFile (File *outfile_report);
        Creates/ Opens the Repot.txt file
        Tells the terminal if file is successfully opened or not
        Returns 404 if unsuccessful

6.	int Print_Line (File *outfile_report, int *fujita_scale, float *path_length_miles, float *path_width_yards, float *affected_area););
        Prints one line into the report file

7.	void Print_Report (File *outfile_report, float *running_total);
        Prints all the lines to the report and then prints the total area affected
        While Get_Data ==1,
        it uses Calc_Area to calculate the area
        then calls Print_Line to print the information to the file
        After this loop ends, it prints the Total Area to the file using variable running_total
        Then prints a success message to the terminal
        Prints each line to the terminal to let user know the progress

8.	void End_Program  (File *infile_tornado, File *outfile_report);
        Closes the files
        Prints a success message to the terminal

    Filled in more comments
Updated on the 15th of November 2022 - V3
    Ran into BUG #2 - Segmentation Error
    Created some test print statements into the functions
Updated on the 16th of November 2022 - V4
    Created multiple print statements for testing purposes 
    Fixed BUG #2 - Segmentation Error
    Made changes to fit into the format expected by the professor
*/

//Bugs
/*
BUG #1 - Segmentation Error - #Fixed
    - First, i added multiple test print statements to the program to try to monitor the flow of the program
        - It also helped me to see what was going on in the program
        - And narrow down the problem
    - Relocated the contents of Open_File to the main function
    - Relocated the contents of Open_OutFile to the main function
    - After these changes, the program ran successfully
BUG #2 - Program would not run - #Fixed
    - Fixed by changing the variable [data_fetched] to a pointer
    - The variable was being used in the function Get_Data
    - After this change, the program ran successfully
BUG #3 - The data in the report file was not being printed correctly - #Fixed
    - Fixed by adding a new line character to the end of the Print_Line function
    - Then added tab spaces using \t
    - After this change, the program printed the file correctly
BUG #4 - Program could only accept integers for the path_width_yards - #Fixed
    - Fixed by changing the variable [path_width_yards] to a float
    - Repeated this for all instances of the variable
    - After this change, the program could accept floats for the path_width_yards
