A hospital supply company wants to market a program to assist with the calculation of intravenous rates.
Design and implement a program that interacts with the user as follows:

INTRAVENOUS RATE ASSISTANT //This is the title of the program

 GIVEN A MEDICAL ORDER IN CALCULATE RATE IN 
(1) ml/hr & tubing drop factor drops / min

 Implement the following functions: 
get_problem —Displays the user menu, then inputs and returns as the function value the problem number selected. 
get_rate_drop_factor —Prompts the user to enter the data required for 
problem 1, and sends this data back to the calling module via output 
parameters. 
get_kg_rate_conc — Prompts the user to enter the data required for problem 3, and sends this data back to the calling module via output parameters. 
get_units_conc — Prompts the user to enter the data required for problem 4, 
and sends this data back to the calling module via output parameters. 
fig_drops_min — Takes rate and drop factor as input parameters and returns 
drops/min (rounded to nearest whole drop) as function value. 
fig_ml_hr —Takes as an input parameter the number of hours over which 
one liter is to be delivered and returns ml/hr (rounded) as function value. 
by_weight —Takes as input parameters rate in mg/kg/hr, patient weight in kg, 
and concentration of drug in mg/ml and returns ml/hr (rounded) as function value. 
by_units —Takes as input parameters rate in units/hr and concentration in 
units/ml, and returns ml/hr (rounded) as function value. 
 ( Hint: Use a sentinel-controlled loop. Call get_problem once before the loop 
to initialize the problem number and once again at the end of the loop body to 
update it.)
