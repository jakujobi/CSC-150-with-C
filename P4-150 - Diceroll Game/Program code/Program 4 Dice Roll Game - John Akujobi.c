/*
This program is a dice roll game
The user will roll a dice and the computer will roll a dice
The following rules determine the winner
    Snake eyes beat Lucky 7.
    Lucky 7 (sum of 7) beats closest to 12
    Closest to 12 wins

//Fixed BUG#1: by using the PressEnter function to reset the time seed for the random number generator in the dice roll function
